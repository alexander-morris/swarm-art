**Proposing test case outline**

The user is asking for an outline for a "swarms" test case involving three agents: director, designer, and critic. The plan needs to summarize modular tests for implementation, following the swarms guide. I need to explore the provided link to understand the structure and details for creating this outline. I'll focus on modular test cases from the guide, even though the document is lengthy. I'll simplify the approach, ensuring it aligns with the guide's instructions. Let me get started on that!


Thought for 7 seconds


Below is an outline for a **Swarms**-based test suite that validates a 3-agent iterative design loop (Director → Designer → Critic → Director…). Each test is written in a modular fashion, following the patterns in the [Swarms LLM guide](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms/blob/master/docs/llm.txt).

> **Agents:**
>
> * **Director**: issues an overall design goal and, on each iteration, ingests the Critic’s report to produce updated directives for the Designer.
> * **Designer**: consumes the Director’s instructions and outputs one or more SVG strings.
> * **Critic**: reviews the Designer’s SVGs and returns structured feedback (e.g. “shapes misaligned,” “color contrast low,” “timing incorrect”) that the Director can act upon.

## 🔍 Short Summary of the Plan

We’ll verify, in isolation and in concert, that:

1. **Director** can emit a valid initial design prompt.
2. **Designer** can generate well-formed SVG markup given that prompt.
3. **Critic** can parse SVG input and return feedback conforming to a known schema.
4. **Director** can consume that feedback and produce a new, refined prompt.
5. **Iteration**: chaining Director→Designer→Critic→Director steps converges toward a predefined target spec.

Each “test” corresponds to one of these steps, plus an end-to-end convergence check.

## 🧪 Modular Test Cases

### 1. `test_director_initial_prompt`

* **Purpose**: ensure the Director issues a clear, structured goal.
* **Setup**: instantiate `DirectorAgent` with no history.
* **Action**: call `director.next_instruction()`.
* **Expect**:

  * A JSON object containing at least `{ "goal": <string>, "constraints": {...} }`.
  * `"goal"` matches the high-level design spec (e.g. `"animate a circle growing from 0 to 100px over 30 frames"`).

```python
def test_director_initial_prompt():
    director = DirectorAgent()
    directive = director.next_instruction()
    assert isinstance(directive, dict)
    assert "goal" in directive and isinstance(directive["goal"], str)
    assert "constraints" in directive and isinstance(directive["constraints"], dict)
```

### 2. `test_designer_generates_svg`

* **Purpose**: validate the Designer produces syntactically correct SVG.
* **Setup**: feed `DesignerAgent` the example directive from Test 1.
* **Action**: call `designer.generate(directive)`.
* **Expect**:

  * A list of SVG strings.
  * Each string parses as XML with `<svg>` root and contains expected elements (e.g. `<circle>`, `<animate>`).

```python
def test_designer_generates_svg():
    directive = {
        "goal": "circle animation",
        "constraints": {"frames": 30, "start_radius": 0, "end_radius": 100}
    }
    designer = DesignerAgent()
    svgs = designer.generate(directive)
    assert isinstance(svgs, list) and len(svgs) == 30
    for svg in svgs:
        # basic parsing check
        assert svg.strip().startswith("<svg")
        assert "</svg>" in svg
```

### 3. `test_critic_provides_feedback`

* **Purpose**: ensure the Critic can analyze SVG frames and output structured feedback.
* **Setup**: give `CriticAgent` a small batch of known-good and known-bad SVGs.
* **Action**: call `critic.review(svgs)`.
* **Expect**:

  * A feedback dict with keys like `"alignment_errors"`, `"color_issues"`, `"timing_mismatch"`.
  * Values are lists or scores that the Director can interpret.

```python
def test_critic_provides_feedback():
    good_svg = "<svg>…valid circle…</svg>"
    bad_svg  = "<svg><rect/></svg>"
    critic = CriticAgent()
    feedback = critic.review([good_svg, bad_svg])
    assert "alignment_errors" in feedback
    assert "color_issues" in feedback
    assert isinstance(feedback["timing_mismatch"], float)
```

### 4. `test_director_refines_prompt`

* **Purpose**: verify the Director ingests Critic feedback and emits a refined directive.
* **Setup**: start from the initial directive and a sample feedback object.
* **Action**: call `director.next_instruction(feedback=feedback)`.
* **Expect**:

  * A new directive dict where certain constraint values have been adjusted in the direction indicated by the feedback (e.g. `"start_radius": 5` if radius was consistently under-sized).

```python
def test_director_refines_prompt():
    initial = {
        "goal": "circle animation",
        "constraints": {"frames": 30, "start_radius": 0, "end_radius": 100}
    }
    feedback = {"alignment_errors": ["radius too small"], "timing_mismatch": 0.2}
    director = DirectorAgent()
    refined = director.next_instruction(previous=initial, feedback=feedback)
    # Expect an increased start_radius or adjusted timing curve
    assert refined["constraints"]["start_radius"] > 0
    assert "easing" in refined["constraints"]
```

### 5. `test_end_to_end_convergence`

* **Purpose**: run a few Director→Designer→Critic→Director cycles and assert that error metrics fall below a threshold.
* **Setup**: instantiate all three agents and define a “target spec” with known acceptance criteria.
* **Action**: loop for N iterations or until `critic.error() < ε`.
* **Expect**:

  * After ≤ 5 iterations, the Critic’s reported overall error is below ε (e.g. 0.05).

```python
def test_end_to_end_convergence():
    director = DirectorAgent()
    designer = DesignerAgent()
    critic   = CriticAgent()
    directive = director.next_instruction()
    for _ in range(5):
        svgs = designer.generate(directive)
        feedback = critic.review(svgs)
        if feedback["overall_error"] < 0.05:
            break
        directive = director.next_instruction(previous=directive, feedback=feedback)
    assert feedback["overall_error"] < 0.05
```

### ⚙️ Wiring Up to The Swarm

* **Agent Definitions**: each agent should subclass `swarms.Agent` and implement the `.act()` or `.generate()` / `.review()` methods.
* **Test Harness**: use `pytest` or the Swarms built-in test runner, mapping each test function to a `SwarmTestCase`.
* **Configuration**: parameterize initial goals and error thresholds via a YAML or JSON config, as per the Swarms guide.

By following this outline you’ll have a **clear**, **incremental** test suite that both validates each agent in isolation and ensures the **holistic** Director–Designer–Critic loop converges to your predefined animation spec.
